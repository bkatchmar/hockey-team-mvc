# Introduction
New laptop, new possibilities, and in this case, I have over 10 years of .NET experience but my GitHub has been very lacking in actual repositories. I am slowly trying to change that largely by creating new repos and cleaning up irrelevant ones. This is my standard hockey team application using the standard suite of .NET Core MVC technologies.

Project was created using the following commands in VS Code;

```
dotnet new mvc -o HockeyTeams
code -r HockeyTeams
```

Code largely written while following steps laid out on [Docs.Microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio)

As always is the case it seems with .NET MVC, every time I step away from MVC development it seems to undergo radical changes. So I am creating this repo starting March 2019 with what should be the most up to date development at the time.
